Test Strategy:
We are trying to cover all the situation and make the network as complex as possible to test our 
protocol mechanisms. Therefore, we are trying to printout the DV/LS forwarding table and port table 
to make sure the update after linkdying and linkreconnect works well.

myTest1:
Just like the LS example on the lecture.
We add several dying and reconnecting to it.

myTest2:
Just like the DV example on the lecture.
We add several dying and reconnecting to it.
